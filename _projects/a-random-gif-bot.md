A Random Gif Bot was my first real program that I released. It was a [reddit](http://reddit.com) bot that used the reddit API to look for comments that contained a certain string. I called these strings hot phrases.

The hot phrases were:

```
'random gif'

'random .gifs'

'random gifs'

'random .gif'

'random.gif'

'a_random_gif' 
```

The gif is randomly chosen from the new section of a few gif subreddits. The bot links back to the original poster to show support for the use of the gif.


The bot was fairly liked on reddit. It was banned from a few subreddits including /r/leagueoflegends, /r/atheism, and /r/anime

I stopped working on this bot after a few months due to lack of interest. [But I have posted the source code on my Github.](https://github.com/BudaDude/a_random_gif-bot)
