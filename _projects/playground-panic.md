Playground Panic was a game created for the [#IndiesVsGamers gamejam](http://jams.gamejolt.io/indiesvsgamers).
           The game was created in 72 hours in Unity3D and Blender. The theme for the jam was "Arcade". I did the programming while my friend [Kyle](https://twitter.com/Kyle_Crafty) did most of the 3D work.
         The game is hosted on Gamejolt and can be played for free.
         
         
The game is about having a nerf gun war with kids at the park. The goal is to take out as many kids as possible without getting shot too many times.
