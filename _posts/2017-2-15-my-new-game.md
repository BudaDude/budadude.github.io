Since July 2016, I have been working on a game I have wanted to make for years. I have always wanted to make a Movie Studio Tycoon game. I draw alot of my inspiration from [The Movies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Movies).

In *The Movies* game, you are given a blank lot to create a movie studio from the ground up. You can hire actors, writers, scientists, etc to create movies and build your movie studio. In a later expansion, you could even hire stuntmen to fill in for your actors during dangerous scenes. The game was pretty niche, even for tycoon games. It had some cool features like being able to create your own movies and exporting them so you upload them to Myspace or early Youtube.  The graphics of this game gave off a serious Sims 2 vibe, even if every character had the same face. I truley fell in love with this game and stayed up many nights trying to make just one movie. The game never got a sequel and due to licensing issues it is hard to find a copy of this game legally.

So I am working on a spirtual successor to this game. I really want to recreate that feeling of owning your own movie studio.  My game will be 2D instead of 3D for various reasons. It will have a base building feel to it and you will be able to create your own rooms and buildings.  I am currently still in early development for it and will not have any sort of demo ready for awhile. I don't even have a solid name for it yet. But I am posting screenshots on my [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/{{ site.footer-links.twitter }}) of what is going on with it.
