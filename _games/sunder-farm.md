Sunder Farm was a game created for [Ludum Dare 34](http://ludumdare.com/compo/2015/12/09/welcome-to-ludum-dare-34/). 
The theme for the competiton was Two button controls and/or Growing. Me and my friend [Kyle](https://twitter.com/Kyle_Crafty) decided to go with doing both themes instead of one, for a bit more challenge.
We were both fans of Harvest Moon and the idea for this game came up pretty quick. We decided to use Unity3D and Blender again for this game.

For this game, I tried my hand at creating a task based AI for our character. It was more difficult than I thought it would be, but I got it done successfully with no known bugs.
The game revolved around planting crops, tending them, and selling them. The goal of the game was to make $200 to pay back your debt. It was a nod to Animal Crossing and being forced to pay back your house loan. I even slipped another hint of that in the store name.

The game received decent reviews. The biggest complaints were the game being slow. Which is understandable. I wish I had added a speed up time button to the game.
